Pacman Game üéÆ:

This is a pacman game project created by Wasee-Ur-Rehman for the second semester. The game was designed with grid concepts in mind and includes two grids: one for moving the pacman and drawing textures like pallets, fruits, and walls, and another for the ghosts to move randomly.

Currently, the ghosts move randomly as the submission deadline is near, but in future updates, pathfinding algorithms will be implemented for the ghosts' movement. When the row and column of pacman's grid matches with that of the ghosts, a collision happens. The game includes different sounds loaded according to movement and textures for an immersive gaming experience.

Installation:

Before using the game, extract all textures and sounds from the directory and ensure that the sfml directories are included in the compiler for proper functionality.

Game Controls:
Use the arrow keys ‚¨ÖÔ∏è‚¨ÜÔ∏è‚û°Ô∏è‚¨áÔ∏è to control the movement of the pacman character.

Credits:

Thanks to SFML library for providing the necessary tools to create this game.

Conclusion:

Enjoy playing Pacman! This game is still a work in progress, and updates will be made periodically to enhance the user's experience.
